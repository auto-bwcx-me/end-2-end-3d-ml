## End to End 3D ML on SageMaker Workshop

This repository contains code for visualizing, training, and deploying a 3D object detection endpoint using MMDetection3D on Amazon SageMaker with the A2D2 dataset.
MMDetection3D provides samples of several datasets, for the purpose of this workshop, we will not be using any of those samples and will instead use the A2D2 dataset.
To reduce processing time we are including pickle files containing paths and some annotation information that will be used in the dataloader. They can be generated using a2d2_converter.py and a2d2_database.py.
